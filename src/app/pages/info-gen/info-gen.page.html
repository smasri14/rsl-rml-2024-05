      <p>to the "Regional Screening Levels for Chemical Contaminants at Superfund Sites (RSL)" and "Regional Removal
    Management Level (RML)" screening level app. This app was developed with DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory
    (ORNL) under an Interagency Agreement. The RSLs are now the source of screening levels for all the EPA regions.
    The RSLs and RMLs provide comparison values for residential and commercial/industrial exposures to soil, air, and
    tapwater (drinking water).  The unified use of the RSLs, to screen chemicals at Superfund sites, promotes national
    consistency.  The RSLs and RMLs are calculated with the same models using the latest toxicity values, default exposure
    assumptions, and physical and chemical properties. To ensure proper use of the RSLs, review the
