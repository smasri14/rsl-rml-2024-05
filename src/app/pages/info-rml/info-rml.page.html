      <p><strong>What are RMLs?</strong><br>
        The Regional Removal Management Levels (RMLs) presented
        on this site are to support the decision for EPA to undertake
        a removal action under CERCLA. They are risk-based, although
        not necessarily protective for long term exposures,
        concentrations derived from standardized equations combining
        exposure assumptions with toxicity data from the Superfund
        program's hierarchy. The RMLs contained in the RML table are
        generic. In other words, they are calculated without
        site-specific information (e.g., the time-frame over which
        individuals may have been exposed to site contaminants).
        However, this website links to the Regional Screening Levels
        (RSLs) calculation tool which allows for the use of
        site-specific data to modify the generic RMLs.

      <p><strong>How are RMLs used?</strong><br>
        RMLs help identify areas, contaminants, and conditions where
        a removal action may be appropriate. Sites where contaminant
        concentrations fall below RMLs are not necessarily “clean”
        and further action or study may be warranted under the Federal
        Superfund program. In addition, sites with contaminant
        concentrations above the RMLs may not necessarily warrant a
        removal action dependent upon such factors as background
        concentrations, the use of site-specific exposure scenarios
        or other program considerations.
